# DFIT-Net
We introduced a DFIT-Net for Multi-organ segmentation.
On top of that, to run our code, please follow the instructions provided in the [DAEFormer](https://github.com/xmindflow/DAEFormer). The setup steps, dependencies, and configuration details are outlined there to ensure that you can run the code smoothly. Make sure to complete all the prerequisites mentioned in the other repository before executing our code to avoid any issues.
